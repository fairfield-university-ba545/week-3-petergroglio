    "## Machine Learning with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a branch in computer science that studies the design of algorithms that can learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical tasks are concept learning, function learning or “predictive modeling”, clustering and finding predictive patterns. These tasks are learned through available data that were observed through experiences or instructions, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hope that comes with this discipline is that including the experience into its tasks will eventually improve the learning. But this improvement needs to happen in such a way that the learning itself becomes automatic so that humans like ourselves don’t need to interfere anymore is the ultimate goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today’s scikit-learn tutorial will introduce you to the basics of Python machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Part 1: You'll learn how to use Python and its libraries to explore your data with the help of matplotlib and Principal Component Analysis (PCA),\n",
    "- Part 2a: And you'll preprocess your data with normalization and you'll split your data into training and test sets.\n",
    "- Part 2b: Next, you'll work with the well-known KMeans algorithm to construct an unsupervised model, fit this model to your data, predict values, and validate the model that you have built.\n",
    "- Part 3: As an extra, you'll also see how you can also use Support Vector Machines (SVM) to construct another model to classify your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with Part 1 now."

    "## Loading Your Data Set\n",
    "The first step to about anything in data science is loading in your data. This is also the starting point of this scikit-learn tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "This discipline typically works with observed data. This data might be collected by yourself or you can browse through other sources to find data sets. But if you’re not a researcher or otherwise involved in experiments, you’ll probably do the latter.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re new to this and you want to start problems on your own, finding these data sets might prove to be a challenge. However, you can typically find good data sets at the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets) or on the [Kaggle](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/www.kaggle.com) website. Also, check out this [KD Nuggets list with resources](http://www.kdnuggets.com/datasets/index.html).\n",

    "But, as you might have gathered already, this is not always __easy__. In some cases, high dimensionality can be problematic, as your algorithms will need to take into account too many features. In such cases, you speak of the __curse of dimensionality__. Because having a lot of dimensions can also mean that your data points are __far away__ from virtually every other point, which makes the distances between the data points uninformative. In other words, you will need __much more__ data points to find reasonable patterns from your data.\n",

    "But don’t worry, though, because the __curse of dimensionality__ is not simply a matter of counting the number of features. There are also cases in which the effective dimensionality might be much smaller than the number of the features, such as in data sets where some features are irrelevant. In other words, it is __safe__ to filter out some of the features that are not as useful.\n",

Remember that this is the same for indices of a list, for example.\n",

    "4. You add a legend to your scatter plot. Use the `target_names` key to get the right labels for your data points.\n",
    "5. Add labels to your `x` and `y` axes that are meaningful.\n",
